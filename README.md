# Amazon Scrapper API

## Introduction

The Amazon Scrapper API is a powerful Node.js application specifically designed for scraping data from Amazon's website. It's crafted to assist developers in collecting product information like names, prices, descriptions, and more. This API is particularly useful for data analysis, market research, and e-commerce applications.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Scraping:** Extracts detailed product information including names, prices, descriptions, ratings, and reviews.
- **Customizable Scraping Options:** Allows users to specify which categories or products to scrape.
- **JSON and CSV Output:** Provides scraped data in both JSON and CSV formats for easy analysis and integration.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage common scraping issues like network errors or changes in website structure.
- **Rate Limiting and IP Rotation:** Features to avoid IP bans and respect Amazon's server load.

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) installed. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solletivivek/amazone-search-api.git
cd amazon-scrapper-api
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the scraping process:

```bash
node index.js
```

For custom scraping, edit the `config.json` with your specific parameters (like product IDs, categories, etc.).

## Configuration

Edit the `config.json` file to customize your scraping requirements:

```json
{
  "targetUrl": "https://www.amazon.com",
  "categories": ["electronics", "books"],
  "outputFormat": "json",
  "proxySettings": {
    "useProxy": true,
    "proxyList": ["http://example-proxy.com:8080", "http://another-proxy.com:8080"]
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

- **GET `/scrape`**: Initiates the scraping process based on the provided configuration.
- **GET `/results`**: Fetches the most recent scraping results in the selected format.
